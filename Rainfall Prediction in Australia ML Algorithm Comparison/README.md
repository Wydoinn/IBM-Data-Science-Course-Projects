# Rainfall Prediction in Australia: ML Algorithm Comparison




**Part of [IBM - Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python?specialization=ibm-data-science)**

In this project, will build a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day.

Will use some of the algorithms, specifically:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- SVM

Will evaluate our models using:
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score

Finally, will use models to generate the report at the end.

### Steps to proceed with.

1.     Splitting the dataset into training and testing data for regression.

2.     Building and training a model using Linear Regression and calculating evaluation metrics.

3.     Creating a final regression report/table of evaluation metrics.

4.     Building and training a model using KNN and calculating evaluation metrics.

5.     Building and training a model using Decision Trees and calculating evaluation metrics.

6.     Building and training a model using Logistic Regression and calculating evaluation metrics.

7.     Building and training a model using SVM and calculating evaluation metrics.

8.     Creating a final classification report/table of evaluation metrics.
