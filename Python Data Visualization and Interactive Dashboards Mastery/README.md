# Python Data Visualization and Interactive Dashboards Mastery

**Part of [IBM - Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization?specialization=ibm-data-science)**

In this project will create visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium. And also will create a dashboard using Plotly and Dash.

**Task 1 - Create Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn & Folium**

- TASK 1.1: Develop a *Line chart* using the functionality of pandas to show how automobile sales fluctuate from year to year.

- TASK 1.2: Plot different lines for categories of vehicle type and analyse the trend to answer the question "Is there a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods?"

- TASK 1.3: Use the functionality of Seaborn Library to create a visualization to compare the sales trend per vehicle type for a recession period with a non-recession period.

- TASK 1.4: Use sub plotting to compare the variations in GDP during recession and non-recession period by developing line plots for each period.

- TASK 1.5: Develop a Bubble plot for displaying the impact of seasonality on Automobile Sales.

- TASK 1.6: Use the functionality of Matplotlib to develop a scatter plot to identify the correlation between average vehicle price relate to the sales volume during recessions.

- TASK 1.7: Create a pie chart to display the portion of advertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives during recession and non-recession periods.

- TASK 1.8: Develop a pie chart to display the total Advertisement expenditure for each vehicle type during recession period.

- TASK 1.9: Develop a countplot to analyse the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the Recession Period.

**Task 2 - Create Dashboard with Plotly and Dash**

- TASK 2.1: Create a Dash application and give it a meaningful title.

- TASK 2.2: Add drop-downs to your dashboard with appropriate titles and options.

- TASK 2.3: Add a division for output display with appropriate 'id' and 'classname' property.

- TASK 2.4: Creating Callbacks; Define the callback function to update the input container.

- TASK 2.5: Create and display graphs for Recession Report Statistics.

- TASK 2.6: Create and display graphs for Yearly Report Statistics.
